# Set files base resources

## Introduction
This file is for set resources like dependencies, css modules and base resources for every .jsx file on our project

For that, we will index JS code on every component of our project for make easier edit and modify neccesary base resources for our components

We'll filther too wich dependencies we need taking in count our component type, this is better explained on <strong>base documentation of project</strong> and in our <strong>diagrams arquitecture</strong>

### pages components
    This components set the base of our projects views, this will be the main container for most of our components, and will be at top of herarchy, so we can say that is the base of our project, and naturally this type of component will take most of dependencies avaible

### main components:
    This components set components as forms, containers and sections for our pages, and usually will be composed for general components, as buttons and basic inputs, this main components are the principal pieces for set our apps.

### general components:
    This component works as reusable components as buttons and are the most basic building blocks for our app, and this compounds bigger components as main components or pages
